I like visualizations and especially maps. For as long as I have been studying linguistics I have also been making maps. In the beginning, I made quite simple maps in Photoshop. In 2013, I made a map of different words for cheese in Europe and posted online. It was later reposted in a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201127170611/https://www.languagesoftheworld.info/etymology/say-cheese.html">blog post</a> by Asya Pereltsvaig in 2014, and led to the formation of the subreddit [/r/etymologymaps](http://www.reddit.com/r/etymologymaps), where it is still (as of 2021) the banner photo, even though many (most) people have perfected the artform since. <img src='https://oplundgren.github.io/website/images/Ost.png' alt="The cheese map" width="400">
