Biography
======

Welcome! I am a PhD student in General Linguistics at Lund University, where I also got my BA and my MA degrees. I have quite broad linguistic interests, which stem from an interest in language history and cultural history. Early on in my education, I took an interest in phonological variation, and I wrote my BA thesis in 2015 on retroflexion in Southern Swedish, a trait not normally found in these dialects, but which have been introduced in some urban accents due to Central Swedish influence. 

In 2017, I studied for one year at UC Berkeley where I took two courses in historical linguistics for Andrew Garrett, while working with supervised independent research on Zaparoan languages for Lev Michael. Inspired by this, I wrote my MA thesis on the Tupí–Guaraní languages Omagua, Kokama and Tupinambá, reconstructing their phonological history and the contact situation which gave rise to these changes. 

After my MA thesis, I worked as a research assistant at Lund University. In this project, I worked with data on gender and noun class, correcting and collecting data on these features from over 3000 languages. I also supplemented the database DiACL with data on gender, and provided this database with harvested cultural vocabulary from existing dictionaries as well.

For a long as I can remember, I have also had a strong interest in Nordic languages and dialects as well. I worked on Swedish accents in my BA project, and in several courses in phonetics. I also studied Icelandic between 2011 and 2014, and Elfdalian since 2012. For my PhD project, I hope to incorporate all of my interests into a larger study on the history of the Swedish language in northern Sweden, Dalecarlia, Finland and Estonia.
